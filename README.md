Image Processing and Segmentation Approaches
This repository contains two approaches for image processing and segmentation using Python. The first approach extracts pixel values from an image, and the second approach performs image segmentation using a pre-trained model.

First Approach: Extracting Pixel Values
Introduction
This approach uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and NumPy to extract pixel values from an image and store them in a NumPy array. This can be useful for basic image processing tasks and analysis.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pillow
NumPy
You can install the required packages using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pillow numpy
Usage
1.Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2.Place your image in a directory and update the image_path variable in the script with the path to your image.
3.Run the script to extract pixel values. The output will be a NumPy array representing the pixel values of the image, where each pixel is represented by an array of three values corresponding to the RGB channels.
Second Approach: Image Segmentation
Introduction
This approach uses PyTorch, torchvision, and the segmentation_models_pytorch library to perform image segmentation using a pre-trained model. Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments (sets of pixels) to simplify or change the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
segmentation_models_pytorch
Pillow
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install the required packages using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision segmentation-models-pytorch pillow numpy matplotlib
Usage
1.Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2.Place your image in a directory and update the image_path variable in the script with the path to your image.
3.Run the script to perform image segmentation. The script will display the original image alongside the segmentation map produced by the model, showing different segments of the image as identified by the model.
